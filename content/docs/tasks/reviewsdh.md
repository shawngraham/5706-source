This week, find a project relevant to your interests on Reviews in DH; review the review: where are the holes in your knowledge? Post in the relevant Discord channel. Pay attention to _how_ the review is constructed. What elements to the reviewers focus on? This is not meant to be a terribly long post; 200 or so words is fine. The idea is that these reviews draw from the 'paradata', or information about process, that help us understand both the humanistic and technical contexts of the work.
