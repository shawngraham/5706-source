## The Task

This week, find a project relevant to your interests on Reviews in DH; review the review: where are the holes in _your_ knowledge? What _a priori_ knowledge seems necessary in order to have made/built/understood the thing being reviewed? **Post in the relevant Discord channel**. Pay attention to _how_ the review is constructed. What elements to the reviewers focus on? This is not meant to be a terribly long post; 200 or so words is fine. The idea is that these reviews draw from the 'paradata', or information about process, choices, data munging, etc, that help us understand both the humanistic and technical contexts of the work.
