## The Task

Explore your peers' digital things. Select one that you find interesting. In the style of [_Reviews in DH_](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/review-process), (and I am explicitly copying their directions below), write:

400 - 500 words:

+ a brief summary of the project and its purpose

+ an assessment of the humanistic claims and evidence

+ an assessment of the technology used/developed

+ identification of interesting, outstanding or problematic issues.

Reviews will not have:

+ ad hominem arguments

+ excessive detail or quotation

+ attacks of any kind, including not being the project the reviewer would have developed.

## Submit

Send as an email to me directly. I will compile so that I can discuss with you each individually what folks found compelling, etc.
