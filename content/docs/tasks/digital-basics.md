## The Task

When you worked your way through the [CYOA](/docs/syllabus/cyoa) syllabus, you would have been presented with a **selection from the 'basics' listed below**. Do not be dismayed by the length of the list.

The goal here is to get you set up with the tools / approaches that you'll need later on. Some of the items below involving merely installing things. Others are more conceptual. A few will involve some actual - gasp! - coding. _You'll be ok_. Do the tutorials as per your selection in the CYOA.
