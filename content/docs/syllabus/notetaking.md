## Notes and Emergent Ideas

You do not have to do this.

But in recent years, I've found that a lot of my research materials are all online. Everything I read, everything I study. I use [Zotero](https://zotero.org) to handle bibliography _and_ to push pdfs to an iPad with [zotfile](http://zotfile.com/); then I annotate as I read on the device, and eventually, retrieve the annotations back into Zotero.

I read on a browser on my work computer too; I use [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) with a private group where I'm the only member to annotate websites and pdfs when I can't be bothered to send them to the ipad.

I use a notebook where I scribble out ideas and page numbers.

All of this material is scattered around. I've long admired the work of Caleb McDaniel, and his [open notebook history](http://wcaleb.org/blog/open-notebook-history). His research lives online, in a kind of wiki. Links between ideas and observations can be made that way and eventually, ideas can emerge _out of the notes themselves_ by virtue of the way they're connected. This is the idea behind what is called the [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) ('slip box', where each idea, each observation is kept on a discrete slip of paper numbered in such a way that connections can be formed):

> A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.

On a computer, such a thing can be created out of a folder of simple text files. Everything I observe, every idea that I have: one idea, one file. Then I use the free 'second brain' software, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to sit 'on top' of that stack of files to enable easy linking and discoverability.

You don't have to do this. But I'd be really interested if you gave this a try this year.

Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

Then download and unzip my [Student Starter Vault](https://github.com/shawngraham/obsidian-student-starter-vault). A 'vault' is just a folder where your notes are found.

Open Obsidian, and explore the default 'help' vault. An important thing to know: the notes are all written in markdown, but somethings you have to hit the note 'preview' button to see what's going on. Hit the note's 'pencil' icon to get back to editing. The 'help' vault will give you a sense of how Obsidian works. When you're familiar with the interface, click the vault icon to open a new vault; find and selec the 'Student Starter Vault'.

When the warning popup about community plugins & safe mode appears, turn safe mode OFF.

This 'vault' is configured with plugins to make it easy to import your zotero notes and bibliography. It has a template to go out and grab your hypothesis annotations. If you drop an image file into the vault, it has a template to do OCR on that image and paste the resulting text into a new note. There are tools in there to help you find connections between your notes; one of them will examine your note and then use some text analysis to find related notes based on the text. As you try the various tutorials in this class, you can also keep notes via Obsidian's 'daily note' feature; this might be handy!

Give it a try; let me know how it works.
